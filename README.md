# Natural-Selection-Simulation--Science-Fair-21-22
A simulator of natural selection with predator-prey relationships.

## Purpose
This software was made for people who want to see the effects of predators on which traits are expressed in what ways in prey. 

## Background Information
### Sexual Reproduction
The benefits of sexually reproducing organisms is that offspring have varying traits allowing for possible adaptations to their environment. 
- Hermaphrodite: An organism that reproduces sexually, but has both sex organs.
- Sexual: An organism that reproduces sexually, but has only one sex organ.
### Asexual Reproduction
The benefits of aseuxally reproducing organisms is that many offspring can be reproduced, and the organisms don't have to exhaust time, and energy in search of a mate.
- Asexual: An organism that can reproduce by itself. These offspring are direct clones of the parent assuming no mutations occur.
